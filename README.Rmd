# myRexerc

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Some interactive R programming exercises with 'learner'.

Beware: all the material must be considered experimental, in full development, not yet tested.

Caveat emptor: use it at your own risk.

## Installation

You can install the development version of myRexerc from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maxbre/myRexerc")
```

Users then  need to install the package 'learnr' directly before running the exercises, for example:

``` r
install.packages("learnr")
learnr::run_tutorial("first_attempt", package = "myRexerc")
```
